'''
Write a streamlit to load the `data/mobile_user_behavior_dataset.csv` file, and display the contents.

Among the quantities: "Data Usage (MB/day)", "Battery Drain (mAh/day)", "App Usage Time (min/day)", "Screen On Time (hours/day)",

build a two drop down selectors to choose two of the quantities to plot against each other in a scatter.


What do you see about the relationship between the two quantities?

What does the data tell you? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
