    "- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).\n",
    "- JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions."
